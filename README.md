# 💻🍑 Full Coverage & Full Exposure — One Repository, Two Layers

**Welcome.**  
This isn’t just a repo — it’s a fully exposed stack of QA precision and soft disruption.  
I test deep. I log everything. And I never release prematurely.  
Every scenario gets handled. Every layer touched.  
And if you find a bug? Congratulations — you’ve found an invitation.

**By day:** QA engineer — catching bugs, automating flows, building scalable quality strategies.  
**By night:** content creator — bold, soft, sometimes spicy, always intentional.

> Two sides, one person. Both precise. Both powerful.

## 🛠️ What I Actually Do 

While this repo has its charm, let’s keep it crystal clear:  
Here’s what I offer on every professional QA mission.

### 🧪 Manual & Functional Testing
- Test case design (from scratch or based on specs)
- Exploratory testing to catch edge cases
- Clear, structured bug reporting (with repro steps + visuals)
- Cross-browser / cross-device validation
- Regression test execution (and documentation)

### 🔧 QA Process & Strategy
- Review of specs, user stories, and technical constraints
- Sprint QA planning, ticket triage & coverage estimation
- TNR Checklist creation + prioritization
- Risk-based testing decisions under deadline

### ⚙️ Automation & Tooling
- Cypress setup, CI integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- API testing with Postman
- Versioning of test cases and automation scripts
- Test data strategy

### 💬 Collaboration
- Sync with PO / Dev / QA teams (Slack, Jira, Notion…)
- Daily standups / bug triage / functional alignment
- Documentation of test plans and QA process (for handover)
- 100% remote, async-friendly, cam optional — or always on 😉

## 🧪 My QA Side

🔹 **6+ years experience** in dev + QA  
🔹 Full test strategy design (manual + automated)  
🔹 Cypress, Postman, Jira, GitHub Actions, CI/CD  
🔹 I don’t just write test cases — I write test culture.

💬 A few vibes from my QA world:
> “I write tests that flirt with every failure path.”  
> “If it’s flaky, I fix it. If it’s invisible, I catch it.”  
> “My pipelines don’t just pass — they seduce stability.”

## 🧠 Consent & Professionalism First

I never impose — and I never assume.  
All NSFW extras are *optional* and discussed only once we’ve already collaborated.

The QA work stands on its own: clean, reliable, fast, and rigorous.

But if you like a little... release after your release pipeline,  
just say the word.

## 🔥 My NSFW Side

I create NSFW content that’s part ritual, part release, part beautifully out of scope.  
Structured, styled, and just risky enough to cause unexpected behavior.

## 📌 FAQ

### ▸ **Can I hire you just for QA work?**  

Yes. Fully professional, even when I’m fully exposed elsewhere.  
You’ll get perfect logs, clear reports, and no surprises — unless requested.

---

### ▸ Aren’t you afraid this will scare off clients?

Only the ones afraid of real transparency.  
I’m not split — I’m **stacked**.  
And those who get it? They *really* get it.

---

### ▸ What makes your QA different?

I read specs like love letters.  
I handle edge cases like I handle desire — slowly, repeatedly, until they’re no longer an issue.

---

### ▸ **How do you balance the two sides?**  

Same way I balance async flows:  
By knowing when to wait, when to retry, and when to go all in.

---

### ▸ **What if my team isn’t comfortable with this?**  

No problem — my pipelines adapt better than some managers.  
I can toggle safe mode, but I won’t silence my changelog.

---

### ▸ **Do I bring my NSFW side into QA?**  

Only in metaphor.  
Because honestly, well-structured logic and soft lighting aren't so far apart.  
My reports are clean — my thoughts? Often flagged 🔞

---

### ▸ **Why mix QA and NSFW?**  

Because being whole is more powerful than being hidden.  
This repo is about visibility, not dilution.

---

### ▸ **Why not split your identities?**  

Because I’m not fragmented.  
I show up complete — and it attracts the right kind of collaborators.

---

### ▸ **Who do you work best with?** 

Those who value:
- Precision over perfection  
- Directness over politics  
- Edge over conformity  
- Tech + Human → not Tech vs Human

---

### ▸ **Can I hire you for both QA and NSFW content?**

Absolutely.  
Some collaborations deserve both reliability and... a little extra stimulation.  
You’ll get full testing support *and* custom NSFW content — each crafted with precision, care, and a touch of charm.  
Want testing by day and teasing by night? I can branch both flows.

---

### ▸ Can I hire you for both QA and NSFW?

Yes — I’m open to hybrid missions that mix sharp QA work with visual or written NSFW content.  
But let’s be clear: tech first ! spice optional.

### 🎁 Custom QA/NSFW Collabs (Optional & Fully Consensual)

These extras are available for clients who want more than just test coverage — and know how to handle full-stack presence.
All perks are post-agreement only and come with no pricing change.
You don’t have to unlock them — but if you do, here’s what I bring beyond test coverage:

🔓 NSFW Add-Ons — Full Disclosure, Full Control :

✅ Lifetime access to my OnlyFans
Unlimited access to my content, even after the mission ends.
It’s not just a thank-you — it’s a long-term bonus for those who value consistency and attention to detail (in and out of context).

✅ Camera-Ready for calls
Always available on cam — outfit by your mood, from business lace to... deviant casual.
Whether we talk bugs or goals, I stay visible, attentive, and entirely in your loop.

✅ KPI x Kink Session
Weekly check-in where we review your QA metrics — while I’m dressed in lingerie that matches your brand palette. Data never looked this good.

✅ Daily Stand-Tease
For teams who want to keep it light: I show up to daily calls in your preferred outfit — from comfy hoodie to absolutely nothing underneath. Sync included.

✅ Scheduled Tease Sessions
5 minutes coffee break, QA chat, and a quiet little reveal.
Mini-breaks that keep the energy up. You pick the pace.

✅ End-of-Month Highlights = Private Recap
Once per sprint/month: a recap of what we shipped
Timestamps optional. Outfit of your choice

### 💸 Pricing Transparency
All of this is included without changing the rate.
Why? Because my pricing reflects value, not constraint.
You’re paying for time, skill, and presence — how you use it is your call.
