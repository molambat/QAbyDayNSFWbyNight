# 🔥🧪 Duality by Design

**Welcome.**  
This isn’t your average portfolio — it’s a curated intersection of clean testing pipelines and unapologetic self-expression.

**By day:** QA engineer — catching bugs, automating flows, building scalable quality strategies.  
**By night:** content creator — bold, soft, sometimes spicy, always intentional.

> Two sides, one person. Both precise. Both powerful.

## 🧪 My QA Side

🔹 **6+ years experience** in dev + QA  
🔹 Full test strategy design (manual + automated)  
🔹 Cypress, Postman, Jira, GitHub Actions, CI/CD  
🔹 I don’t just write test cases — I write test culture.

💬 A few vibes from my QA world:
> “I don’t chase releases — I anticipate them.”  
> “Clean code is cool. Clean test logs? Even sexier.”  
> “My pipelines purr when triggered.”

## 🔥 My NSFW Side

I create sensual content — part aesthetic, part performance, part play.  
Not vulgar. Just confident. Sometimes explicit. Always mine.

> Even my softest back-end. 🍑✨

## 💬 Why bring them together?

Because I'm not hiding.  
Because smart & sexy can live in the same repo.  
Because being technically skilled doesn’t mean being bland.  
Because curiosity comes in many forms.
