# 🔥🧪 Duality by Design

**Welcome.**  
This isn’t your average portfolio — it’s a curated intersection of clean testing pipelines and unapologetic self-expression.

**By day:** QA engineer — catching bugs, automating flows, building scalable quality strategies.  
**By night:** content creator — bold, soft, sometimes spicy, always intentional.

> Two sides, one person. Both precise. Both powerful.

## 🧪 My QA Side

🔹 **6+ years experience** in dev + QA  
🔹 Full test strategy design (manual + automated)  
🔹 Cypress, Postman, Jira, GitHub Actions, CI/CD  
🔹 I don’t just write test cases — I write test culture.

💬 A few vibes from my QA world:
> “I write tests that flirt with every failure path.”  
> “If it’s flaky, I fix it. If it’s invisible, I catch it.”  
> “My pipelines don’t just pass — they seduce stability.”

## 🔥 My NSFW Side

I create sensual content — part aesthetic, part performance, part play.  
Not vulgar. Just confident. Sometimes explicit. Always mine.
