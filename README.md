# 💻🍑 Full Coverage & Full Exposure — One Repository, Two Layers

**Welcome.**  
This isn’t just a repo — it’s a fully exposed stack of QA precision and soft disruption.  
I test deep. I log everything. And I never release prematurely.  
Every scenario gets handled. Every layer touched.  
And if you find a bug? Congratulations — you’ve found an invitation.

**By day:** QA engineer — catching bugs, automating flows, building scalable quality strategies.  
**By night:** content creator — bold, soft, sometimes spicy, always intentional.

> Two sides, one person. Both precise. Both powerful.

💬 A few vibes from my QA world:
> “I write tests that flirt with every failure path.”  
> “If it’s flaky, I fix it. If it’s invisible, I catch it.”  
> “My pipelines don’t just pass — they seduce stability.”

## 🧠 Consent & Professionalism First

I never impose — and I never assume.  
All NSFW extras are *optional* and discussed only once we’ve already collaborated.

The QA work stands on its own: clean, reliable, fast, and rigorous.

But if you like a little... release after your release pipeline,  
just say the word.

## 🔥 My NSFW Side

I create NSFW content that’s part ritual, part release, part beautifully out of scope.  
Structured, styled, and just risky enough to cause unexpected behavior.

Yes — I’m open to hybrid missions that mix sharp QA work with visual or written NSFW content.
