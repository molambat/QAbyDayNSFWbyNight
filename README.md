# 💻🍑 Full Coverage & Full Exposure — One Repository, Two Layers

**Welcome.**  
This isn’t just a repo — it’s a fully exposed stack of QA precision and soft disruption.  
I test deep. I log everything. And I never release prematurely.  
Every scenario gets handled. Every layer touched.  
And if you find a bug? Congratulations — you’ve found an invitation.

**By day:** QA engineer — catching bugs, automating flows, building scalable quality strategies.  
**By night:** content creator — bold, soft, sometimes spicy, always intentional.

> Two sides, one person. Both precise. Both powerful.

## 🧪 My QA Side

🔹 **6+ years experience** in dev + QA  
🔹 Full test strategy design (manual + automated)  
🔹 Cypress, Postman, Jira, GitHub Actions, CI/CD  
🔹 I don’t just write test cases — I write test culture.

💬 A few vibes from my QA world:
> “I write tests that flirt with every failure path.”  
> “If it’s flaky, I fix it. If it’s invisible, I catch it.”  
> “My pipelines don’t just pass — they seduce stability.”

## 🔥 My NSFW Side

I create NSFW content that’s part ritual, part release, part beautifully out of scope.  
Structured, styled, and just risky enough to cause unexpected behavior.

## 📌 FAQ

### ▸ **Can I hire you just for QA work?**  
Absolutely.  
Yes. And I’ll stay fully clothed — unless the payload requires deeper authentication.

---

### ▸ **How do you balance the two sides?**  
Same way I balance async flows:  
By knowing when to wait, when to retry, and when to go all in.

---

### ▸ **What if my team isn’t comfortable with this?**  
I’m not here to shock — I’m here to deliver.  
But if a touch of spice scares them off, maybe their code isn’t ready for deployment anyway.

---

### ▸ **Do I bring my NSFW side into QA?**  
Only in metaphor.  
Because honestly, well-structured logic and soft lighting aren't so far apart.  
My reports are clean — my thoughts? Often flagged 🔞

---

### ▸ **Why mix QA and NSFW?**  
Because being whole is more powerful than being hidden.  
This repo is about visibility, not dilution.

---

### ▸ **Why not split your identities?**  
Because I’m not fragmented.  
I show up complete — and it attracts the right kind of collaborators.

---

### ▸ **Who do you work best with?**  
Those who value:
- Precision over perfection  
- Directness over politics  
- Edge over conformity  
- Tech + Human → not Tech vs Human
